# Writing mathematics

Writing maths is painful in most of the static site generators as they do not support mathematics natively.
This is the case with Pelican also. 
However the reStructuredText format parser built into Python used by Pelican has native support to [write mathematics](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/mathematics.html).
